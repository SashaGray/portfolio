		<h2>The process</h2>
	    <img src="../images/coding1.png" alt="Portfolio"/>
		<p class="text">The "Build your portfolio" assignment was about making my own portfolio using HTML and CSS coding. <br>I had made a prototype earlier, but I wasn't happy about the design and the navigation on that one. It wasn't very user-friendly. So this time I tried doing it another way, to make it more user-friendly. For example I put in a navigation menu at the top of the screen, that follows the user around on all the pages. <br><br>I have used a lot of coding to make this as simple as possible. <br>To see my GitHub folder with all the coding <a href="https://github.com/SashaGray/portfolio" target="blank">click here!</a></p>

		<h2>The results</h2>

		<p class="text">The result of my portfolio is actually this website you are using right now. The result is very simpel, but it also has my very own touch on it. The colors and the simple theme and the whole system, represents me very well as a person. <br>With this project I have learned a lot about coding and designing in HTML and CSS. I have learned the basics of how to make a website from scratch and put my own personal touch on it as well, as I have learned a lot about the styling of a website. <br> See my finished portfolio <a href="../index.html" target="_blank">click here!</a></p>
