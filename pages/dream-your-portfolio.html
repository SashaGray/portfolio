		<p class="text">The "Dream your portfolio" assignment was about making a prototype of my own portfolio, using the program Adobe XD. <br>I tried making it as simple as possible with discret colors and not too much going on.<br>This program was easy to use, but as it was just for prototyping I couldn't link to anything, and I was very limited. <br><br>See my process (in danish) <a href="../external-links/portfolio-opgave.pdf" target="_blank">here!</a></p>

		<h2>The result</h2>

		<p class="text">The result of my portfolio protoype was very simple and easy to use and navigate. I think that is important when making websites, because the easier it is to use the more people can and will use your website. <br>I made my prototype so I had a frontpage where you can navigate from there. Thoug I now think that i should have made a navigation bar with navigations to all the pages, follow you around my prototype. <br><br> See my finished prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/e794aa47-54ba-4d43-4661-eccb69026a4c-91a5/" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
