		<h2>Copenhagen photoshop</h2>
	    <img src="../images/bridge.png" alt="Portfolio"/>
		<p class="text">This was my first photoshop project at school, where we were to take picture of Copenhagen and then photoshop it.<br> I chose to photoshop some new elements in to the picture. For example the red balloon and the swan. Besides that I also changed the colors and I removed some elements that were just making noise in the picture.</p>

		<h2>Swans photoshop</h2>
	    <img src="../images/swans.jpg" alt="Portfolio"/>
		<p class="text">This was just a photoshop project I did for fun. I took the picture myself and I thought it was too dark. You couldn't see the swans the way I wanted to. Therefor I played with the contrast and some colors to make the water 'pop' more in its colors, and also so the swans were more visible. <br>Here I also removed some dots and noise that would desturb the picture.</p>
